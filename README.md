# DOMINUS

The aim of this project is to create nearly from scratch our own operating system and to use it on a raspberry pi to exectute some simple tasks. 
Here the task consits on switching a LED on/off when clicking on a domoticz switch, by the use of a relay.
To do so, TCP client and server are implemented, domoticz is the client and the raspberry is the server, waiting for commands.


## Configuration

### Startup scripts

The `dominus` file must be placed as is in the `/etc/init.d` directory.  
The `dominus.sh` file must be completed with the absolute path of the root of the Dominus folder and then placed into the `/etc/profile.d` directory.

The following command must be executed in a shell:

		sudo update-rc.d dominus defaults 80

Then reboot the system, the server is operational!


### Domoticz scripts

The scripts `switch_on.sh` and `switch_off.sh` must be bind with a virtual switch from Domoticz. Therefore they must be placed into the `Domoticz/scripts` directory.


## Src

This folder contains the sources for the project. Here are the different folders :

* app contains the main programs which start the application

* domoticz contains the example `create_sensor` which create a virtual sensor on domoticz

* lib contains the following libraries :
    * gpio which contains the `gpio_switch` library for the creation and control of the gpios
    * tcp which contains the `tcp_server` and `tcp_client` for the communication between domoticz and the raspberry pi

* scripts contains the following shells :
    * `switch_off` and `switch_on` which calls the gpio_switch library to control the LED
    * `dominus` that must be placed into the `/etc/init.d` directory which starts all the project
    * `dominus.sh` that must be placed into the `/etc/profile.d` directory to initialize the environment variables


## Relay's Implementation

## Docker

This file allows you to create an image based on a debian image, and that automatically download and compile the buildroot for the RPi3.

This image includes :
* A root session which password is `toor`
* A user session which name is `user_1` and password `user_1pw`
* Domoticz is installed and automatically starts when the RPi3 boots.

In order to creates this docker, you just have to run this command line where the .dockerfile is :

		docker build .

You can give the image a name with the `-t` option.

NB : The whole running of this command took me about 40 minutes. It works (and have been tested) with a stable internet connexion (there are not the settings for the ENSTA's proxy, and it doesn't work with the unstable wifi connexion of the school).


The ID of the image is returned at the end of the running of the build command. Otherwise, you can find it by running this command :

		docker image ls

After that, you can create a docker container from the image by running :

		docker run -it <image_ID> 

The image for the sdcard can be found in `/root/buildroot-2017.08/outputs/image`. 
You can also copy it by running :
